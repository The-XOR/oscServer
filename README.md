OSC Bridge for RackPlugins

RackPlugins are controllable by OSC through this bridge.
Use:
Set the destination address (name or IP and port #) of the 
OSC controller, and define a listening port on the PC. The
server is automatically recognized by the plugins (no configuration
is needed); when the connection is established the DIGITAL led on
the plugins goes lit.

Requirements: .Net Framework 4.5 or above
